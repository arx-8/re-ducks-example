# re-ducks example

I think `re-ducks` is the best design of React state management.<br>
This project is an example of the history leading to `re-ducks`.<br>
(Not completely the same as the official `re-ducks`. I arranged that a little.)

For comparison, Implement several patterns.<br>
These are history of React state management design in 2019.

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run lint`

Run ESLint with autofix & Type check.<br>
If you want to NO autofix (= Dry run):

```sh
npm run lint-dry
```

### `npm run typesync`

Install missing TypeScript typings for dependencies.

If you want to install together, you can run:

```sh
npm i ${PACKAGE_NAME} && npm run typesync && npm i
```

### `GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=true npm run analyze`

Analyzing the bundle size.<br>
Output to `misc/source-map-explorer.html`.

### `npm run eslint-print-config`

See [`ESLint --print-config`](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface#--print-config)

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
